VagrantSpice
============
The purpose of VagrantSpice is to simplify and standardize how the different machine providers are configured across cloud providers for Vagrant machines.

The primary example in the current version is getting a CoreOS Fleet cluster up and running across Amazon AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, Google, and Rackspace.  The current repository has 27 Data centers among these providers working with CoreOS images.

If you take a peak at the VagrantSpicedir and the provider/consumer config files you can see pretty quickly where we are defining in a structured and consistent way what is typically defined loosely through the Vagrant DSL.

# This branch includes Docker , ScaleIO and Flocker Docker Plugin support for AWS

- Configure VagrantSpice
- vagrant up --no-parallel
- vagrant ssh mdm1

# <a name="Summary">Summary</a>


Each provider maintains its own configuration parameters.  Some of these parameters are unique per provider but others are more generally applicable.  In addition, different providers have different default behavior for VM templates, network connectivity, firewalls, storage and other configurable items.  By abstracting above the Vagrantfile, VagrantSpice allows a single configuration of boxes to work across any pre-configured provider.  It can be as easy as specifying a hostname and everything else just works regardless of which cloud.

This simplification requires a level of abstraction for commonality to occur.  This can limit the capabilities of certain cloud providers to only common aspects among other providers.  This is a natural by-product of making cloud provider capabilities align, but there is still the option to leverage custom provider options as well.

-------
VagrantSpice is currently in early stages of development under <a href="http://emccode.github.io">EMC {code}</a> standard practices focused on open development.  The project is finishing the discovery phase with a working object model across the five clouds specified.  Cloning from the Github repo will ensure the latest versions.

<br>

# <A name="Install">Install</a>
VagrantSpice requires that providers are generally working with a normal Vagrantfile first.  The primary details here are specific to authentication.  With this you can take the configuration parameters and populate them in the spice-conf/consumer_config.rb file along with populating relavant certificate files in the provider/cert directory.


	git clone https://github.com/emccode/vagrantspice
	cd vagrant-spice/VagrantSpicedir  
	vi spice-conf/consumer_config.rb
	mkdir provider/cert
	cp yourcertdir/cert provider/cert/.





# <A name="Usage">Usage</a>
Enter a provider directory and issue a standard ```vagrant up``` command. VagrantSpice will then assist in dynamically feeding Vagrant DSL to allow Vagrant to create machines as normal.  

Prior to this ensure that
- Vagrant is installed
- Vagrant plugins are installed (vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws) or updated (vagrant plugin update)
- Required items are available (key pairs, SSH keys, firewalls/networks, etc) and possibly at **each region**.  Naming key pairs and firewall/networking groups identically between regions will simplify configuration.



Use these steps for general VagrantSpice.  You might want to edit the ```provider/boxes_config.rb``` file to limit the amount of machines deployed.

	cd VagrantSpicedir/
	vi spice-conf/consumer_config.rb
	cd provider1
	vagrant up

Use these steps to run VagrantSpice with the CoreOS demo.

	cd VagrantSpicedir/
	curl -s https://discovery.etcd.io/new | more
	vi spice-conf/consumer_config.rb
	- find :etcd_url and replace the URL
	cd provider1
	vagrant up
	cd ../provider2
	vagrant up


If you choose a single vm name, you must also specify the ```--provider=name``` flag.

Following this, to delete the machines it is as simple as ```vagrant destroy -f```.  It is good practice to log into the provider from time to time to ensure the VMs running are needed and that orphan disks are not around.

In order to test the configuration, you must find the public address of the VM with ```vagrant ssh-config coreos01``` and then open a web browser session to ```http://ip:4001/```.  You should see the following ```Hello World from Go in minimal Docker container```.  We are mapping TCP 8080, avaialable under our pre-created firewall policy of ```standard``` or ```default``` for AWS or other provider with firewalls (see firewall section).  

- CoreOS with <a name="examples_fleet">Fleet and Etcd</a>
 - Available from ```spice-examples/global-fleet-boxes_config.rb``` but requires that you generaete a new etcd cluster identifer from ```curl -s http://http://discovery.etcd.io/new | more``` and replace under ```:etcd_url```.

- CoreOS with <a name="examples_snake_charmer">Snake Charmer</a>
 - Snake Charmer is a project from EMC CODE that focuses on building Docker containers to test and use object services and is available <a href="https://github.com/emccode/snake_charmer">here</a>.  Using the combination of VargrantSpice and Snake Charmer allows you to fire up Docker containers in no time that can use object services.
 - Using the simplest ```spice-examples/global-coreos-boxes_config.rb``` you can run CoreOS in a manual mode and leverage Docker from SSH to run Snake Charmer.  If using Google, they do not currently have a GCE datacenter on the East Coast so the ```central``` region can be used instead.  Consult the locations table.
 - We can leverage the EMC CODE ```s3proxycmd``` Docker container to list files.
	```docker run -e 'access_key=user055' -e 'secret_key=key' -e proxy_host=object.vipronline.com -e proxy_port=80 -ti emccode/s3proxycmd```
 - Go ahead and run the session interactively instead byu speciying ```--entrypoint=/bin/bash``` as ```docker run -e 'access_key=user055' -e 'secret_key=key' -e proxy_host=object.vipronline.com -e proxy_port=80 --entrypoint=/bin/bash -ti emccode/s3proxycmd```
 - First run ```run_s3_proxy_cmd.sh``` if you have supplied proxy information to create the ```/tmp/.s3cfg``` file.  Otherwise you can run ```s3cmd --configure``` to use ```s3cmd``` without a proxy (do not specify --config if doing this).
 - Following this commands like ```s3cmd --config /tmp/.s3cfg ls``` will work.
 - Create a file of random data ```head -c 50M < /dev/urandom > file```
 - Upload the file to an S3 provider ```s3cmd --config /tmp/.s3cfg put s3://testing/file``

 - You can also run ```s3cmd --configure``` once in the

The following providers have been configured already within VagrantSpice.  If there is a provider that is not listed, the ```provider\_config.rb``` and ```consumer\_config.rb``` files must be updated with relevant normalizing information.

<A name="Firewall">Firewall</a>
----------
Providers handle firewalls differently.  Some do not employ any firewall services while others have extensive capabilities.  The provider layer we are working with at VagrantSpice is based on Vagrant machine cloud provider plugins.  These plugins all receive the configuration or non-configuration of firewall settings differently.

There are three methods.  The *group* method allows you to specify the actual groups of firewall rules to apply.  The *rules* method allows you to specify firewall rules dynamically.  The *pre-existing* method assumes you pre-create firewall rules that are applied to all VMs that are brought up under a project or group and does not require configuration from VagrantSpice.  And *N/A* means the provider does not employ firewall services.

| Provider   |  Method  |
|:----------:|:--------:|
|AWS|Group|
|Azure|Rules|
|Digital Ocean|N/A|
|Google|Group|
|Rackspace|Pre-Existing|


For the CoreOS demo, at a minimum ```TCP 4001 and 7001``` need to be open to allow proper ```etcd``` communications.  As well, ```TCP 22``` must be open for ```SSH```.

#### Azure Example - boxes_config.rb
> :firewall => "4001:4001,7001:7001"

#### AWS Example - boxes_config.rb
These are pre-configured and must be available in each region that you are provisioning to ahead of time.

> :firewall => "['default','standard']"

#### Google Example - boxes_config.rb
The network specified must be pre-configured.

> :firewall => "default"

<A name="Storage">Storage</a>
-------
Storage can be considered another configuration parameter that differes between providers.  This is similar to networking where the exposure of the ability to modify sizes depends on whether the provider allows it and whether the Vagrant machine provider exposes this capability.  This storage is beyond what is offered from the instance types.

| Provider   |  Allowed | Vagrant  | VagrantSpice |
|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|AWS|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Azure|Yes|No|No|
|Digital Ocean|No|No|No|
|Google|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Rackspace|Yes|No|No|

Once storage is provisioned it must be consumed by the guest file system.  For CoreOS this can be done via a cloud config file.  

#### AWS Examples - boxes_config.rb
> :storage => "[{ 'DeviceName' => '/dev/xvdb', 'Ebs.VolumeSize' => 100 }]",

#### Google Example - boxes_config.rb
This storage does not need to be configured inside the guest since it represents the additional ```/``` partition size.
> :storage => '100'



<A name="machine_customization">Machine Customization</a>
-------------
The boxes_config.rb file specifies at a minimum the names of the machines.  There are a range of possibities other than this and chances to set these extra parameters at a more global level.  More detail in the examples sections, but in general you can specify settings at the Box, Boxes, Instances, Instance Types, Consumer, and Provider levels.  The ```Vagrantfile-template.rb``` can provide insight to logic, priority and ordering.

	{
	  :boxes => [
	    {
	      :hostname  =>  'google-coreos01',
	      :common_location_name => 'us_central',

	      :common_image_name => 'CoreOS-stable',

	    }',
	}


<A name="instances_config">Instances Config</a>
-----------------
This area allows us to configure some global defaults for instances.  These defaults may be overridden by higher layers (box, boxes, etc).  We are specifying a few things along with a custom ```cloud-config``` file.  As part of the CoreOS process we are actually creating a new file and running the standard ```coreos-cloudinit``` command against this new file.

Another interesting part is the ```public_ipv4=`curl -s ip.alt.io``` command.  This does a ```whoami``` request to ```ip.alt.io``` which returns the IP that the machine is known as publicly.  This is what we use as the public address.

	       'coreos-fleet' => {
	        :common_instance_type => 'small',
	        :common_image_name => 'CoreOS-stable',

	    },

<A name="other_defaults">Other Defaults</a>
--------------
The consumer_config.rb file contains other defaults and plugin configurations.

Notice the ```core``` default parameter for ```etcd_url```.  This must be updated by issuing a  ```https://discovery.etcd.io/new``` command and retrieving the URL shown.

The following section shows a peak under the hood, or a view of the alignment between providers for the characteristics of the deployed machines.  As configured right now, this also represents the limitations of what is currently configured.  Providing more images, instances, and location at each provider will expand the usefulness of this project.
<br>

<A name="Images">Images</a>
------
The following table represents the similar images among default configured providers.  This is an example of how we take a common iamge name of the left column and align them among providers.

| Image   |  AWS  |  Azure      |  Digital Ocean  |  Google  |  Rackspace  |  Virtualbox
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|----:|----:|----:  
|CentOS-64-x64|ami-454b5e00|5112500ae3b842c8b9c604889f8753c3__OpenLogic-CentOS-65-20140926|6.5 x64|centos-6-v20141021|CentOS 6.5 (PVHVM)|puppetlabs/centos-6.5-64-nocm (box)
|CoreOS-stable||||
|CoreOS-beta||||
|CoreOS-alpha||||


<A name="Instances">Instances</a>
----------
The following table includes instance types or sizes that are deployed to the machines at each provider.  This is an example of taking a common instance type on the left column and align them against providers.

| Instance Type   |  AWS  |  Azure      |  Digital Ocean  |  Google  |  Rackspace  |  Virtualbox
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|----:|----:|----:  
|micro||||||
|small||||||
|medium|t2.medium|Medium|2gb|n1-standard-2|1 GB General Purpose v2|N/A
|large||||||
|lowcpu_13mem||||||
|lowcpu_26mem||||||
|4cpu_lowmem||||||
|8cpu_lowmem||||||
|max_cpu||||||
|max_memory||||||

The ```micro, small, medium, and large``` instances are balanced between memory and cpu.  

The rest of the instances attempt to normalize between providers by using an instance that **at least** satisfies said amount.  Instances starting with ```lowcpu_``` are focused on high memory to cpu ratios.  Instances ending with ```_lowmem``` are focused on high cpu to memory ratios.  The ```max_cpu``` targets ```16 cpus``` and the ```max_memory``` instance targets ```100GB```.


<A name="Locations">Locations</a>
----------------------
The following table represents the physical location choices among providers.  

| Location   |  AWS  |  Azure      |  Digital Ocean  |  Google  |  Rackspace  |  Virtualbox

<A name="instance_type_lookup">Instance Type Lookup</a>
-----------------------
This is a peak at the abstraction for the instance type.  Here you can see a call to small refers to the ```google.machine_type``` parameter and ```n1-standard-1```.

	 :instance_type_lookup => {
      'us_central' => {
        'micro' => {
          :name => "google.machine_type = 'f1-micro'",
          :type => :alias,
        },
        'small' => {
          :name => "google.machine_type = 'n1-standard-1'",
          :type => :alias,
        },
        'medium' => {
          :name => "google.machine_type  = 'n1-standard-2'",
          :type => :alias,
        },
        'large' => {
          :name => "google.machine_type  = 'n1-standard-8'",
          :type => :alias,
        },
      },


<A name="images_lookup">Images Lookup</a>
--------------
This corresponds to generic names such as ```CoreOS-444.5.0-(stable)``` and referring to the actual image name of ```coreos-stable-444-5-0-v20141016``` at Google.

	 :images_lookup => {
	  'us_central' => {
	        'CentOS-6.5-x64' => 'centos-6-v20141021',
	        'CoreOS-stable' => 'coreos-stable-494-5-0-v20141215',
	        'CoreOS-beta' => 'coreos-beta-522-3-0-v20141226',
	        'CoreOS-alpha' => 'coreos-alpha-549-0-0-v20150102',
	      },
	    },
	  },

<A name="images_config">Images Config</a>
--------------
Here we specify the image name at the provider followed by which ssh username must be used for that image.  In the case of the CentOS image, the name on the certificate supplied is used.  But in the case of CoreOS the default ```core``` username is used.

    :images_config => {
      'centos-6-v20141021' => {
        :ssh_username => 'clintonkitson'
      },
      'coreos-stable-494-5-0-v20141215' => {
        :ssh_username => 'core'
      },
      'coreos-beta-522-3-0-v20141226' => {
        :ssh_username => 'core'
      },
      'coreos-alpha-549-0-0-v20150102' => {
        :ssh_username => 'core'
      }
    },

# <A name="Notes">Notes</a>
Having the provider plugins used in standard ways demonstrates the disparity among them.  There are subtle differences in synchronous/asynchonous behaviors where up/destory commands might act differently.

<A name="abstracted_vagrantfile">Abstracted Vagrantfile</a>
----------------------
For those interested, here is what is left of a Vagrantfile in a provider directory.  Its primary purpose is just to include and run the template Vagrantfile and configuration files.

	require 'resolv'


	config_files = [
	  '../spice-conf/consumer_config.rb',
	  '../spice-conf/ip_resolver.rb',
	  '../spice-conf/object_config.rb',
	  '../spice-conf/instances_config.rb',
	  '../spice-conf/images_config.rb',
	  '../spice-conf/config_steps.rb',
	  '../spice-conf/provider_config.rb',
	]

	working_directory = Dir.getwd

	config_files.each {|file|
	  file_path = "#{working_directory}/#{file}"
	  contents = File.read(file_path)
	  var_name = file.split('/')[-1].split('.')[0]
	  eval("$#{var_name} = #{contents}")
	}

	boxes = eval(File.read('./boxes_config.rb'))

	$provider = File.basename(Dir.getwd)
	eval($provider_config[$provider][:requires])
	ENV['VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER'] = $provider

	eval(File.read('../spice-conf/Vagrantfile-template.rb'))


<A name="Networking">Networking</a>
----------
Different public cloud providers also leverage different networking capabilities.  Some assign public IPs directly to interfaces of the machine, while others leverage NAT and private IP spaces.  In addition, some provide intra-VM communication between machines while others only allow communication through public IP addresses.  VagrantSpice has many options here, but the default is to allow communication between VMs using the public internet routable IP address to maintain cloud interoperability.

<A name="Limitations">Limitations</a>
-----------
The project has built the framework to normalize for cloud providers but only works for a CentOS 6.5 x64 and a small or medium instance type.

As an abstraction above a Vagrantfile you will find a lot of the settings are done via strings and evals.  This leaves some flexibility in allowing for unplanned scenarios.


# <A name="future_statement">Future Statement</a>
The project currently is serving as Vagrantfile abstraction.  You can think of it as bringing structure to something that through a domain specific language was unstructured but very powerful.  The downside is that it is currently a layer above Vagrant which can make it difficult to troubleshoot with standard Vagrant knowledge.  Let's see where this goes!

# <A name="Contributing">Contributing</a>
Please contribute in any way to the project.  Specifically, normalizing differnet image sizes, locations, and intance types would be easy adds to enhance the usefulness of the project.
